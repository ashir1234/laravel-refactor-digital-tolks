# Test for `willExpireAt` method in TeHelper class

## Description
The `willExpireAt` method in the `TeHelper` class is responsible for calculating the expiration time of a job based on its due time and creation time. This method is used to determine when a job will expire and needs to be completed. The test ensures that the method correctly calculates the expiration time and returns a `Carbon` instance representing the calculated time.

## Test Case
The test case involves the following steps:
1. Create a mock due time and creation time for a job.
2. Call the `willExpireAt` method with the mock due time and creation time.
3. Assert that the method returns a `Carbon` instance.
4. Assert that the returned `Carbon` instance represents the correct expiration time based on the given due time and creation time.

## Run Test
Please run `php artisan test` to run the test

## Test Method
```php
use Tests\TestCase;
use App\Helpers\TeHelper;
use Carbon\Carbon;

class TeHelperTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testWillExpireAt()
    {
        // Create mock due time and creation time
        $dueTime = Carbon::now()->addHours(20);
        $createdAt = Carbon::now();

        // Call the method under test
        $result = TeHelper::willExpireAt($dueTime, $createdAt);

        // Assert the result
        $this->assertInstanceOf(Carbon::class, $result);
        $this->assertEquals($dueTime, $result);
    }
}
